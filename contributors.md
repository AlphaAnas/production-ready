### Guidelines for Developers
1. Before sharing any code, confirm that it hasn’t already been submitted. If you plan to modify existing code, contact the developer through their LinkedIn profile first.
2. Ensure your code is production-ready and adheres to industry standards. It’s fine if it takes a few iterations to meet this standard.
3. Properly comment on your code before submitting a pull request (PR), as incomplete documentation and missing comments may result in rejection.
4. If a writer has created a blog for your code, include a reference or link to it in the readme.
